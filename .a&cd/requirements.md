## Requirements

Basically the reporter must output the hierarchically formatted test results in the console (see readme).

### Additional Output

The reporter as well must output:

- Test failure reasons logs;
- Code exceptions logs;

Minor additions:

- Colored test result marks: success (green) / failure (red);
